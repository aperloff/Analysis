#sections:
# other input files to include in INPUT
# global options in OPTION
# 1D histograms in HISTO
# 2D histograms in HISTO2D
# datasets in SET
# selections in SELECTION
# variations in VARIATION
#option format is: type:name[val] or vtype:name[val1,val2,...]
#available types are (full/abbrev): bool/b, int/i, double/d, string/s, color/c, chain/ch, input/in
#items on each line in the HISTO, HISTO2D, SET, SELECTION, VARIATION sections must be tab-separated, with required items first, in order
#HISTO/HISTO2D: only required item is name (but without binning options afterward, it won't build properly)
#SET: required items are type (stack, hist, base), subtype (data, mc, ext), name
#SELECTION/VARIATION: only required item is name
#for datasets, child-parent relationships are indicated by tab-indentation
#selectors/variators are associated with a selection/variation by tab-indentation
